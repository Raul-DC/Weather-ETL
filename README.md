# Weather-ETL
This project demonstrates an end-to-end ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process for weather data

The main components include:

1. Data Extraction: Weather data is collected from a public API, providing real-time information.

2. Data Loading: The extracted data is loaded into a relational database (PostgreSQL) for storage and initial structuring.

3. Data Transformation: Using Python, the raw data undergoes a transformation process to meet the required format for analysis.

4. Data Warehousing: The transformed data is then loaded into Google BigQuery for long-term storage and further analysis.
